This is a Unity3d game that generates a box fractal. Once generated, there is a
custom input map to an Xbox controller that allows for manipulation of the
different "generations" of fractals.

**Controls:**

*L/R Triggers -* Rotate generation selection  
*L/R Bumpers -* Set local rotation direction  
*A -*  Translate generation away from center  
*B -* Translate generation towards center  
*X -* Reset generation position  
*Y -* Reset generation rotation  
*L/R Joysticks -* Rotate generation around global axis
